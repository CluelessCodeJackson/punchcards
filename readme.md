punchcards is a project to help a user learn new programming languages.  

It contains a series of directories on standard programming topics to help a user learn the basic syntax of a language, and a set of various challenges that they can test themselves on.  Each folder will contain source files for multiple programming languages.  Each programming langauge will contain two source files.

The first a basic template for the challenge that includes no actual code to accomplish the task.  The user's aim for these files is to add the necessary comments to accomplish the tasks at hand.

The second is a reference file with working code.  The user is able to refer to this source file to see working code.
